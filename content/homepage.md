The homepage contains 4 primary content components that help inspire and move the user forward, emphasize booking and introduce users to opportunities available when they Fly Delta.

 


## Hero

The hero is used to inspire and move forward. When customers are signed in, we encourage them to pick up where they left off.



*   Use minimal, precise, energetic language
*   Write first for mobile, communicating optimism & energy with limited space
*   Always offer a simple, verb-driven call to action that makes the next step immediate
*   Use second person "you" or the user's name as often as possible because this personalization will help the user feel welcome and drive conversion
*   Avoid excessive, long-winded copy or punctuation, which could distract the user from taking the next step to engage further — especially on mobile

<h4>Variants</h4>

Heading and subheadings can be grouped together and aligned in 3 different ways. Centered, left-aligned, and right-aligned. This allows for flexibility in selecting photographic assets while retaining legibility.

## Dynamic Touts

Used for Deals and Destinations dynamic touts have a Title, Price, Image,  and CTA.  Customers can add to wishlist from this component. For launch, only the 2-up variant is used.



*   Do not include copy here, unless it's explicitly needed for a legal reason
*   Destination, price and trip details will all drive conversion without a caption
*   CTA – "Book" or "Book Now" will provide an immediate next step
*   CTA – Never use "Learn More" or "See More"

## Promo Quilt



*   Headline – Limit the headline to a maximum of 4-5 words. Try to use a simple verb if possible, inviting the user to picture the benefit from their perspective. Words that communicate excitement like, "earn" or "redeem" or "embark" or "give" or "share", etc.
*   Caption – Limit the caption to 2-3 short sentences max, illustrating the benefit or the experience — or possibly offering a preview of a benefit that a customer will learn more about later. Write the caption with the mobile experience in mind.
*   CTA – You do not need to include any call to action in copy, the red arrow on the right and whole photo will be clickable, to drive users to more information naturally.
