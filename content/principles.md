<p class='lead space-bottom'>Design principles are a directional framework used by a business and design team to make decisions. There should be few and they should be quotable. More specific than general best practices or truisms, they should take into account specific needs of the user, needs of the business and its brand values. Ideally they help speak to a unique goal or aspect of a product or brand.</p>

<h4>Efficiency over Decoration</h4>
<p>Fresh Air imbues a modern and clean aesthetic that prioritizes utility and function over decoration. Taking an ‘app-like’ approach with a focus on task completion facilitates speed and performance, while rich imagery, liberal use of clear space and large typography offer focus and clarity of content.</p>
<div class='flex-row'><p class='example'>Example</p> <p>While motion can be of great benefit in crafting an experience, we should never risk significant impact to performance.</p>

<h4>Essential over Everything</h4>
<p>Only show what is essential and focus on the most likely case rather than the edge case. Through research and listening to customer feedback, we work hard to prioritize and surface the content most important as a baseline for each experience. Navigation structures, content hierarchies and primary user controls are all designed with an implied direction for use, rather than displaying all of the details at once.</p>
<div class='flex-row'><p class='example'>Example</p> <p>A consolidated confirmation page in Fresh Air booking offers a succinct summary and clear next steps.</p>

<h4>Personal over General</h4>
<p>Consider each experience as though it were a face-to-face conversation. We naturally design for the Millennial Business traveler, Mile Maximer and Luxury Seeker, but we challenge ourselves to consider an even more tailored experience for each customer. The key being that we begin to solve problems for the individual which reduces friction,and increases conversion, customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
<div class='flex-row'><p class='example'>Example</p> <p>Rather than a general homepage hero, we offer a personal greeting and can encourage resumption of shopping for an abandoned cart.</p>

<h4>Adaptable over Consistent</h4>
<p>As the digital footprint of the brand grows, so does the responsibility of creating a consistent customer experience across channels. To accommodate this, we should endeavor to use a consistent voice and design language with each new experience created. However, that system should also be adaptive to changing technology, needs or context of the user, and needs of the business.</p>
<div class='flex-row'><p class='example'>Example</p> <p>Shopping on mobile should look to the context of the user, over consistency with the desktop.</p>

<h4>Iterative over Final</h4>
<p>We believe in a continuous optimization of our products. The design is never done; it is a careful and deliberate evolution in pursuit of the optimal customer experience. The best experiences begin as sketches, rapidly transform to prototypes, and evolve to alpha and beta releases with live users and real customer data shaping the experience along the way.</p>
