<h3>Voice & Tone Guide</h3>

<h4>CONTENT INTRODUCTION</h4>



This guide defines how to write and shape written content in the Fresh Air system for Delta Air Lines. Through all of our content for digital spaces or initiatives, we use functional, active web copy to:





*   **Guide.** We offer travel expertise to guide our users — both to the answers they seek and to complete actions. Actions like finding a flight or signing up for SkyMiles.
*   **Inform.** We use short phrases and simple language to tell readers what they need to know. We always present them with opportunities to explore or engage further.
*   **Inspire.** When appropriate, we choose language that emboldens customers to take their own journey. We elevate marketing language, in appropriate places.
*   **Personalize.** Wherever possible, we tailor our language to fit each individual customer. This makes Delta sound online just like we do at the ticket counter.


<h4>VOICE INTRODUCTION</h4>

Delta's established brand voice comes to life through the Fresh Air initiative. In some ways, it's activated or fine-tuned to fit the needs of digital spaces and initiatives. We know our digital voice must be able to thrive in many digital mediums. Keep in mind, voice and tone are not the same.



* Like a person's voice, the **Delta Digital Brand Voice** defines how the brand at all time's in digital mediums. It includes diction, emphasis and repetition of phrases or calls-to-action.

* Also like a person's voice, the **Delta Digital Tone Variations** define how the brand's voice changes depending on the situation. We'll get to how it changes a little later.



<h4>DELTA DIGITAL BRAND VOICE</h4>

When it comes to Delta online, we speak in digital spaces just like we speak in person. With the clarity and confidence of a real-life Delta Air Lines representative.

Generally, we communicate energy and optimism, supported by a deep sense of service and respect — focused on the specific benefits and superior services offered by Delta. Often, we're focused on helping someone complete a task or potentially solve a problem, where we speak with both optimism and clarity to help a user continue their journey.

In all digital spaces, we use efficient, precise, punctuated sentences. We're never long-winded, always offering a sense of forward motion that drives the reader to engage and quickly find what they're seeking on a page or interface. This parallels the forward motion that customers experience on their journeys with Delta. This way, we activate our communications to enhance the customer's climb.

We serve globally in digital, so we speak globally. We avoid isolated figures of speech, expressions or pop-culture references. We also aim to communicate timelessly. So, no matter how long it's been since content went live, each word reads as evergreen and relevant to our customers.

We offer clear expertise and knowledge that comes from a lifetime as an industry-leading airline. This sentiment often presents itself as determination, expertise and confidence. Though we're self-assured, we're never verbose or unapproachable to our customers.

We often emphasize the amenities and benefits of traveling with Delta. Rather than just highlighting our products, we're always focused on how our products or offerings benefit our customers. We share and celebrate benefits, but never in a way that feels overwhelming or excessive.

At the same time, we know when to cut back and simplify our speech too. Like when we explain complicated, financial, legal or technical requirements. We never try to interject sentiment or informality into complicated or technical program sections. As always, we're simply there to assist.

<h4>DELTA DIGITAL BRAND TONE VARIATIONS</h4>

Just like a person's voice, the Delta Digital Brand Voice itself does not change — but our tone changes to address different scenarios. This enables us to serve our customers at any part of their journey on digital platforms, so that we always offer clarity and assist customers through their journey.

Components
------

**1. NAVIGATION & SUB-NAVIGATION**

In Fresh Air, we surface pages through the main navigation and sub-navigation to direct users to relevant content.



*   Due to space limitations in the navigation, try to keep page titles as short as possible — **aim for 5 words or less per title**
*   To promote SEO, we title each page using phrases that are easy-to-understand and if possible, incorporate keywords or key phrases

** **

**2. H1 PAGE INTROS/ H2 HEADLINES / GENERAL HEADLINES**

In Fresh Air, headlines run a little shorter and can be restricted by space. To address this need, we make sure headlines are



*   Capitalized in Title Case (_like this_)
*   No more than 7-8 words, but less if possible
*   Descriptive to help users orient themselves on a page
*   Providing a preview of the content a user will find in the section below

** **



**3. SUPERHEADERS**

In Fresh Air, superheaders are used above a headline to help a user navigate a section.



*   The superheader will always be the title of a parent page, indicating the topic for a complete section.

** **

**4. CAPTION HEADERS / EXPANDER HEADERS**

A caption header often breaks up copy, serving as an introduction to bullets, steps or an expander that opens in a drawer-like fashion to show more information.



*   A CAPTION HEADER IS STYLED IN ALL CAPS _(like this)_
*   A caption header should preview the information the comes below it in succinct, clear language that uses SEO keywords or phrases if possible.

** **

**5. PRIMARY CALL-TO-ACTION / SECONDARY CALL-TO-ACTION**

Both calls to action are used throughout the Fresh Air design system to drive action at different key points in a user's journey.



* All calls-to-action should be in ALL CAPS or Title Caps.
* A **Primary Call-to-Action** is a red button that asks a user to take an action, it should be around 4 words or less and must contain a verb to drive click-through.

      * Go to My Trips

      * Purchase Now

      * Sign Up

      * Log In

      * Discover Details

* A **Secondary Call-to-Action** is a white or blue button that asks a user to take an action. It should be around 4 words or less, but is less urgent than the Primary Call-to-Action. Often, the Secondary Call-to-Action comes after the user of a Primary. It shows the secondary choice.
      * Go Back

      * Cancel

      * Or, Go to My Trips

* Click-through rates drop when generic calls-to-action are used, because they don't set expectations or build anticipation for a user's next steps. Try to avoid these if possible.
      * Try to avoid, "Learn More"

      * Try to avoid, "See More" because it isn't true for users engaging on a screen reader

      * Try to avoid, "Read More" because again it isn't true for users engaging on a screen reader

** **

**6. GALLERY CAPTIONS**

Gallery captions sit underneath an image and are often used to showcase features of a product or cabin.

* For accessibility, make sure the caption describes exactly what's in the image

* Keep captions brief, but link to more information if a user wants to engage further

* Try to keep links in-line with the text. For example, link the word "Delta Comfort+" in a caption that describes food in Delta Comfort+

** **

**7. BODY COPY**

The Fresh Air design system works to make body copy easier to scan. Most often users in digital spaces do scan, jumping from paragraph to paragraph until they find the answer to a question or next step they're looking for.

* Keep sentences active and as short as possible, which allows a person to easily scan and click-through on a call-to-action

* Avoid over-stuffing paragraphs. Instead, divide content by topic. It's always possible to add an additional component to house more information if needed

* If a paragraph "looks to long" it probably is. Shorten paragraphs and add more components for additional information, so nothing feels long or cumbersome to a user

** **

**8. TOUT CALLOUTS**

Touts serve as a small "feature" space that should address a small topic and offer a user an immediate change to take an action.

* The tout should describe clearly and briefly the urgent information or need

* If it requires it, the tout should provide a clear and immediate call to action

* Not all touts require CTAs and may just be stand-alone for

** **

**9. ICON CAPTIONS**

Captions underneath icons help a user navigate to content elsewhere or further down on the page.

* Captions should clearly describe what the icon represents, this helps a visually-restricted user know the meaning of the icon even if they're unable to see it

* Captions should generally be 2-4 words, but the shorter the better

** **

**10. DRIVING CONVERSION WITH LANGUAGE**

In many environments, Fresh Air often calls for content that drives a user to "convert" or click-through to another step. Whether that's purchasing a flight, signing up for SkyMiles or something else, we keep a few key points in mind to make sure we're driving towards conversion.

*   	Keep copy as brief, energetic and clear as possible; Reduce the amount of copy around calls-to-action

*   	Use active voice to drive readability and make the purpose of each section clear

*   Try to avoid passive voice as often as possible, especially when the design limits the space or you're guiding a user to a call-to-action

*   	Remove any nonessential information

      *   Long, technical or legal information can be included in drawers and summarized with a quick headline above the drawer

*   	When you can, cut the copy and use visual elements instead

      *   In the Fresh Air system, this can include interactive calendars, charts, photos, videos, maps and more

** **

**11. NEWS OR TIMELY CONTENT**

In the Fresh Air system, we treat news & press releases a little differently. We differentiate news stories to help users know what they're looking at. Generally, news will sit on a white background for readability.



In all cases, news or press releases should include:

*   	**Dateline** - "Month DD, Year" should be listed to help user identify that content is timely

*   	**Headline** - If it's news, a short headline should summarize the content below

*   	**Lead** - If body copy of an article is previewed, the lead of the article should be displayed
